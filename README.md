## Description

Note Taker is a simple, efficient web application designed to streamline the process of note-taking. Motivated by the desire to create a user-friendly platform for jotting down thoughts and organizing tasks, this project solves the problem of scattered notes and lack of organization. It was built to demonstrate a practical application of full-stack development skills, combining frontend and backend technologies. Throughout this project, I learned about setting up a server, handling HTTP requests, and dynamically updating the user interface.
